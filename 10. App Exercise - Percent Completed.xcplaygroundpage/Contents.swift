 ## App Exercise - Percent Completed

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 You decide that your fitness tracking app should show the user what percentage of his/her goal has been achieved so far today. Declare a variable called `percentCompleted` and set it to 0. Do not explicity assign it a type.
